# Automatic-generation-of-database-generated-from-Excel-documents

In this VT, solutions are to be found to correctly read data from Excel documents and insert it into a database with the help of EPPlus. The aim of the work is to demonstrate this with a corresponding proof of concept. In addition, an application with UI is to be created in which an Excel document can be uploaded from which the data is to be read. When the corresponding function is activated, a preview of the table to be created in the database is to be shown. For this purpose, it should be possible either to confirm the preview or to make changes to the schema manually.
